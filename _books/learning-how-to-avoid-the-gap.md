This is a physical book which will require some additional work to produce notes for this site.  It's also one of the most powerful ideas I've learned.

Essentially, there two kinds of thought patterns that are prevalent in the world.

 - Measuring progress against the ideal.
 - Measuring progress against where you started.

Dan Sullivan has experienced that people who measure against where they started are much happier with their lives.  A big reason for this is that the ideal is something that is unobtainable and always a moving target.  If you measure progress from where you started, you will always see progress.  If you measure based on where you want to go, you will be unlikely to see progress as your ideal keeps moving farther out from where you currently are.
