I am switching up my diet to experiment with prolonged ketosis.  First question, how to add a significant quantity of fat without carbs and extra protein.  Today, I review sour cream.

| Product | Total Fat in container | Price | $/g fat |
|---|---|---|---|
|Green Valley Organics Lactose Free| 340g / 30g * 9g = 102g | $4.49 | $0.04401|
|Snowville Creamery Creme Fraiche | 336g / 30g * 11g = 123.2g | $5.99 | $0.04862|
|Wallaby Organic | 454g / 30g * 10g = 151.333g| $4.69 | $0.03099|

<br/>
Hands down, the winner by taste was Green Valley Organics.  The lactose free part is just a bonus.  
The lowest cost, and still tasty, product was Wallaby Organic.  

I learned this week that too much protein can raise blood sugar to levels that will prevent ketosis.  Adding sour cream to my diet should help me reduce the amount of protein I consume.  

My target macro-nutrient levels are:  
Carbs: 20g or less  
Protein: approximately 128g  
Fat: 141g  

The goal is to plan out my meals in such a way that I don't have to count macro nutrient levels for everything I eat.
