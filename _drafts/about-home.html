              <li><strong>Analytical:</strong> I search for fundamental reasons why things are the way they are.  I uncover the essential facts needed for excellence in any endeavor.  I clarify what excellence means and how it can be achieved.</li>
              <li><strong>Strategic:</strong> I see possibilities where others see complexity.  I ask powerful questions to build understanding of the issues.  I find the answers necessary to determine the most effective course of action to achieve an optimal outcome.</li>
