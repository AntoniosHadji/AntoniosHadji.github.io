Donald Trump (12)
https://www.donaldjtrump.com/issues/
COMPETENT LEADERSHIP: America needs strong leadership. Politicians can talk but they don’t get things done. I have a strong track record of success and if elected I will do what I have promised to do: MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
DRUG EPIDEMIC: The New Hampshire drug epidemic must stop. If elected POTUS — I will create borders and the drugs will stop pouring in. We will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
LIVE FREE OR DIE: Live Free or Die: A motto for the whole country to follow.
THE 2ND AMENDMENT: Politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd Amendment. I won’t let them take away our guns!!
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS: Being politically correct takes too much time. We have too much to get done!
SELF FUNDING: I am self funding my campaign so I don’t owe anything to lobbyists and special interests. I will bring the greatest negotiators and smartest operators to Washington to help Make America Great Again!
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: If we don’t have borders, we don’t have a country. We need to BUILD A WALL that will keep illegal immigrants out.
UNIFYING THE NATION: I will unify and bring our country back together. We will be unified, we will be one, we will be happy again.
EDUCATION: I will end common core. It’s a disaster.
THE ESTABLISHMENT: I want to win for the people of this great country. The only people I will owe are the voters. The media, special interests, and lobbyists are all trying to stop me. We won’t let that happen!
THE MILITARY: I will make our Military so big, powerful and strong that no one will mess with us.
THE ECONOMY: \$19 trillion of debt and growing is a crushing burden to leave young Americans
